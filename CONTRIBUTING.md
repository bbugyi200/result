# Contributing


## How to submit feedback?

The best way to submit feedback is to [file an issue][1].

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are
  welcome :).


## Developer's Guide

### üî¢ Basic Usage

Before making a PR please run the following

* Optional one time setup: run `make use-docker` if you need to build/test this
  with docker
* `make lint` to check for any format or convention issues
* `make test` to run all tests

### ‚ùì How do I ...?

<details><summary>üîß See available make targets</summary>

To see available make targets, simply run `make`.

</details>

<details><summary>üê≥ Switch to and from using Docker</summary>

To start using Docker, run `make use-docker`. Every subsequent make command you
run will then be run inside the associated container whenever appropriate.

To stop using Docker, run `make remove-docker`. Every subsequent make command
you run will then be run inside your native virtual environment whenever
appropriate.

</details>

<details><summary>üõ† Add a new pip dependency</summary>

New dependencies need to be added to `requirements.in`. Your `requirements.txt`
will then automatically be updated to reflect those changes the next time a
relevant make target is run. Alternatively, you can run `make
update-requirements`.

Note:
* Before any make command is run, requirements are synced so that the
  development environment matches your `requirements.txt` exactly i.e. extra
  packages that are not present in the `requirements.txt` are removed and any
  missing packages are installed. This helps providing a consistent environment
  across platforms, and ensures that whenever requirements change, only minimal
  updates are performed.
* Check out
  [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools#pip-tools--pip-compile--pip-sync)
  for more information.

<details><summary>üôà Ignore linting violations</summary>

For
[flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html#configuration-locations)
[violations](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/violations/index.html),
you can:
* ignore a rule for a single line of code using a `#noqa` comment e.g.
  ```python x = 1 # noqa: WPS111 ```
* [ignore](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/violations.html#in-line-ignoring-errors)
  a rule for an entire file by adding it to `flake8.per-file-ignores` inside
  `setup.cfg`.
* [exclude](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/violations.html#ignoring-entire-files)
  an entire file from flake8 checks by adding it to `flake8.exclude` inside
  `setup.cfg`.
* ignore a rule for all files by adding it to the `flake8.ignore` list inside
  `setup.cfg`.

For
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#the-mypy-configuration-file)
violations, you can:
* [ignore](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#spurious-errors-and-locally-silencing-the-checker)
  type checking for a single line of code using a `# type: ignore` comment.
* [ignore](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#ignoring-a-whole-file)
  type checking for an entire file by putting a `# type: ignore` comment at the
  top of a module (before any statements, including imports or docstrings).

For
[pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/5.0.1/usage.html#configuration-files)
violations, you can:
* [ignore](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/5.0.1/usage.html#in-file-configuration)
  a rule for a single line of code using a `# noqa` comment (this can be
  combined with flake8 exclusions).
* exclude an entire file from pydocstyle checks by excluding it from
  `pydocstyle.match` inside `setup.cfg`.
* ignore a rule for all files by adding it to the `pydocstyle.ignore` list
  inside `setup.cfg`.

For [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/config.html#)
violations, you can:
* [exclude](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/5.0.1/usage.html#in-file-configuration)
  a single line of code using a `# pragma: no cover` comment.
* [exclude](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/source.html#specifying-source-files)
  an entire file from coverage checks by adding it to the `coverage:run.omit`
  list inside `setup.cfg`.
* [exclude](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/excluding.html#advanced-exclusion)
  all lines matching a given pattern by adding it to the
  `coverage:report.exclude_lines` list inside `setup.cfg`.

<details><summary>üß™ Run specific tests</summary>

First, get a shell inside your development environment by running `make
dev-shell`.

You can then use the pytest `-k` option to select tests based on their names,
e.g.

```bash
python -m pytest -k "included_test"
```

You can also use "and", "or" and "not" keywords e.g.

```bash
python -m pytest -k "included_test or not excluded"
```

</details>

<details><summary>üìÑ Build and view docs from a local version</summary>

You can generate docs locally by running `make build-docs`. You can then see
the generated docs by running

```bash
cd docs/build
python -m http.server
```

and going to http://localhost:8000/

<details><summary>üç™
Update my project to match the cookiecutter which generated it
</summary>

This project is enabled with `cruft` to be able to update the template with any
improvements made in the [cc-python][4] cookiecutter which generated it.

* `make check-cc` will report if this project is up to date or out of sync with
  the cookiecutter.
* `make update-cc` will update this project to be in sync with the cc-python
  cookiecutter. This can give improvements or new features which are added to
  the template after this project was created. Note one should do this on a
  clean branch. After running this it is a good idea to run `make all` to
  rebuild everything and ensure things still work after the update.

## New Releases

This section serves as a reminder to the maintainers of this project on how to
release a new version of this package to [PyPI][3].

Make sure all your changes are committed, that you have added a new section to
the [CHANGELOG.md][5] file, and that you have [bumpversion][2] installed. Then
run:

```bash
bumpversion patch  # possible values: major / minor / patch
git push
git push --tags
```

A new version of `result` will then deploy to
PyPI if all CI checks pass.
